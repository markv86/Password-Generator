This assignment was really something else for me. There was very difficult tasks to overcome. Like, if conditions, for loop, addeventlistener. The most simplest one that blew me away was a simple "return". It was my missing piece that I didn't know existed. This was a lot of fun once things started to come together.

I was able to explore HTML, CSS and Javascript in this assignment. The truth is definitely, "code code code" will make you better. I am much more proficient after this assignment.
