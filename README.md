## Assignment 3

<p>

This assignment was really something else for me. There was very difficult tasks to overcome. Like, if conditions, for loop, addeventlistener. The most simplest one that blew me away was a simple "return". It was my missing piece that I didn't know existed. This was a lot of fun once things started to come together.
